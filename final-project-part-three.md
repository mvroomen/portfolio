[Here is my final project on Shorthand!](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/7f529938-8832-46db-8ab6-410236ed987f/)

# Changes made since Part II
<!--
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 
-->

Since part II, I have made a lot of changes to my story!  Even though my wireframe had already gone through several rounds of feedback and edits, I still hadn’t quite figured out the exact story I was trying to tell.  After a few days of reflecting on the comments that I received and thinking about the story in the context of my upcoming presentation, the narrative finally became clear.

One of the first changes I made was to eliminate the scrollmation of news articles.  First, they weren’t creating the effect I was hoping for, and they distracted from my story’s introduction.  Second, I figured out I couldn’t get permission for the photos associated with the headlines, which made me realize that programs like Netflix’s “Explained” probably use screenshots of only headline text due to copyright issues, not only for dramatic effect.

The next small change I made was the aesthetics of my family tree.  I had originally tried to make the background dark brown to fit the vibe of “old family photos”, but it did not work at all and made the family tree look like it was designed by an elementary schooler.  Therefore, I switched the background color to white to match Shorthand and modified the other colors to fit the new background.

After that, I thought about the feedback I’d received on the map of Limburg and debated showing a map extent of Europe to help the audience place Limburg and the Netherlands at the continent level.  However, upon further reflection, I realized that the exact geographic location of Limburg wasn’t pertinent to the story and that the audience didn’t need to spend too much time worrying about maps.  I also assumed that someone who would care to know exactly where Limburg was, probably already knows where the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany are, so the map I’ve provided meets their need.

One issue I faced in Part II was working with Shorthand and Rawgraphs.io for the first time, without tons of time for troubleshooting.  This resulted in my “grand finale” graph, the alluvial graph of the employment transitions of miners from 1965 to 1972, being too small, too narrow, and nearly unreadable.  However, with the feedback I received from my interviews and classmates, I brought the graph into Canva, added the necessary context, including a title, axes labels, and legible mine, new employment, and percentage labels.  Then, with the much more audience friendly graph, I made an entire Shorthand section, which allows the reader to take in the true chaos of the situation, while actually being able to read the graph.

With my newfound clarity, I was able to find some additional effective media to help me communicate my story, including pictures of modern-day Limburg and a photograph of Polish immigrants in Limburg meeting for the first meeting of the Polish Catholic Society” in 1915.  Although I had previously planned to add a ton more information and graphics and media and charts, as I describe below, I eventually realized my ambitions were not only unrealistic, but that I had a story that just needed a bit more clarity and support, not a scrapbook’s worth of additional text and media to look at. Therefore, once I found a few more supporting images, I realized I had enough to provide the context for my story.

Below, I discuss a few more changes that led me to my final, Final Project!

## The audience
<!--
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.
-->

The audience for my final story is still lifelong learners, students learning about economic development, researchers and policymakers making important decisions regarding employment transitions, and members of the general public.  During their hour long coffee and reading before work, their Sunday morning browsing, or their late night falling down the rabbit hole because they can’t sleep, they can come to my Shorthand Story, learn something new, and walk away extra confidence to demand what people deserve when an industry declines and people need help.

In order to best serve my intended audience, I made several specific adjustments from Part I and Part II.  Firstly, I shortened the length of my overall story – not of the story itself, but of the amount of detail I explored in this particular telling of the story.  My feedback from interviews, speaking with classmates, and making my presentation for our class helped me realize that I was overloading the audience with too much background and contextual information, which distracted from the main point of my story, inspiring people to learn about Limburg’s post-coal recovery and empowering people to demand new jobs, training opportunities, and transition assistance when/if their industry faces a similar fate.  Therefore, I consolidated the number of sections in my story to make it easier to digest and make reading it more enjoyable.

## Final design decisions
<!--
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

Despite the fact that I know entire teams of people working together for several months are required to make the shows, comprised of 45 minute episodes, that served as inspiration for my story - Finding Your Roots with historian Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and “How We Got to Now” with author Steven Johnson, I still couldn’t quite get it in my head that I couldn’t make a “mini” version of their type of storytelling.  I was originally overambitious in the depth of detail I hoped to convey despite having very limited time.  I had a hard time letting go of the level of detail I had hoped to add, which would have required accumulating large amounts of primary source data and media, as well as design/technical skills far beyond my current ability.

My final design decisions came as a result of the discoveries I made in the lead up to my presentation.  When forced to think about the most important aspects of my story in the context of making a one minute presentation, it brought me back to the reality of my story.  Preparing for and practicing my presentation helped me realize that my story was adequately thorough despite the fact that it covered less than a 45-minute-long episode of television or 15-20 minute episode of Netflix’s explained!  After coming to this realization, I started to enjoy the process a little more and was able to finally decide what sections to expand and what to cut to create the story most suited for my target audience.

At the beginning of this course, I often felt overwhelmed by how many things I needed to learn.  I had never used GitHub, Tableau, Flourish, RawGraphs.io, Shorthand, or many of the other tools we explored before.  However, while I was preparing my presentation of this story for the class, it suddenly dawned on me that I was making the class much harder on myself than it needed to be.  The course is called “Telling Stories with Data”, not “Telling Data Stories”.  The data isn’t the “main character” – the story is!  When I finally had this mind shift, everything came together.  Data for data’s sake isn’t storytelling.  Sometimes, the data is the story, or the best way to communicate a particular story.  But oftentimes, like with my story, the data provides context and/or evidence, almost like a photo is worth a thousand words.  Although I wish I had been able to learn all the tricks of the trade for the various tool we worked with in these seven short weeks, I’m still very proud of the work I was able to do and the story I was able to tell.  Two weeks ago, I’d never heard of an alluvial graph.  However, the day we learned about it, I knew it was a perfect choice for part of my story.  Now, I have an alluvial graph that demonstrates the chaos of a region figuring out its identity after the end of a major industry, as well as a kind note from the social scientist who reviewed my story that she can’t stop thinking about the graph!  It’s been a wild 7 weeks - maybe one day I’ll make a chart about it.

Thank you for coming to my portfolio and following along with my learning journey!
