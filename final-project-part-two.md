# Wireframes / storyboards
<!--
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

[My Storthand Wireframe](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/c323c075-7a7b-4534-81d6-db28712a289d/)

Since I prefer not to have post information on the internet, I opted to use a randomly generated url since Shorthand implied that would keep my Shorthand story off search engines.
 
In order to now overwhelm my critique participants, I used a combination of "lorem ipsum" text blurbs and main idea phrases to help provide minimal context, rather than my full textblurbs.  My hope was that by focusing on the charts and overall structure, I could ensure that my narrative was sufficient, clear, and effective.

# User research 

## Target audience
<!--
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 
-->
My general target audience is lifelong learners, especially those in the US and Canada who may also have connections to the Dutch coal mining industry.  My specific target audience is students learning about economic development, researchers and policymakers who will be making important decisions regarding employment transitions, and members of the general public who are in the deeper phases of researching economic transitions on the internet.

Because I'm aiming for a diverse audience, I've attempted to take a fairly casual, yet educational tone, based off that Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr. on the PBS show "Finding Your Roots".  I'm hoping to strike a balance between my audience learning something new, but not needing to have an in-depth understanding of the Netherlands, its geography, or its politics.

## Finding Interviewees

For my interviewees, I selected three individuals.  For my first interviewee, I selected a Dutch relative who would be able to tell me if my story is authentically representing what actually happened in a truthful, accurate, and clear manor.  Second, I selected a social science researcher who could tell me if my story flowed well, told the social science story I hoped to tell, and if I had enough evidence to support my claims in terms of context/data (at least based on the outline).  For the third individual, I selected a friend who is not very familiar with social sciences, nor economic development, who knows my family is Dutch, and knows that the Netherlands is somewhere in Europe. 

Note:  I had originally used my story arc to conduct preliminary research with interviewees where I sought information on creating a similar timeline on coal mining in Southwestern Pennsylvania.  Based on that feedback, which suggested I keep the story focused on Limburg, I was back to square one in terms of next steps.  However, after the wonderful feedback of my classmates in our in person critique session on Monday, February 21, I created a brand new wireframe based on an entirely new way of presenting my story!  Luckily, with the addition of Tuesday, I was able to conduct my interviews, receive excellent feedback, and plan for my next steps!

## Interview script
<!--
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 
-->

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Is it a story? |  What is the most memorable element of the wireframe?  If you had to tell someone what you learned in one sentence, what would you say?  |
| Clarity |  If possible, can you note if and when you got confused?  How could that element be made more clear?  Is there anything "unfixable"?   |
|  Quality of Evidence  |  Knowing that the text will be primarily providing the story, not adding statistics or providing additional geographic/economic context, is there anything you would add?  Do the supporting images and charts help provide evidence and context for the story?  Are there any images or charts that feel unnecessary? |
|  Redundancies  | Since you know me, you know my way of telling stories and communicating is often quite circular, or in other words, I can be redundant.  Are there any areas of my Shorthand that you think appear redundant/unnecessary/ would make you want to scroll past of stop reading?  What, if anything, should I cut and why?  |

## Interview findings
<!--
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.
-->

As I mentioned above in my questions, I speak in a very circular manner.  Therefore, for each goal, I asked all of the associated questions in one long blurb.  To avoid forcing any readers of my portfolio to read those blurbs twice, I will simply list the "Goal" associated with the series of questions in the chart below.  Similarly, I used a combination of paraphrases and direct quotes to summarize the major insights from my interviews!

| Questions               | Interview 1 (adult, mid-60s, Dutch) | Interview 2 (adult, early-60s, social scientist) | Interview 3 (adult, early 30s, environmental scientist) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| "Is it a story?" Questions      | Quote:  The Dutch went from having ads in Italy to me having work trips in Italy where I work with a Dutch man who left the Netherlands.  Paraphrase:  I think you capture nicely how the Netherlands went from being a major coal powerhouse to having no mines left in Limburg to eventual honoring their coal past.  It works.  |  Paraphrase:  The story worls well, but make sure you specify what the Dutch did between 1965 and today to make it work.  The job chart shows some of what happened, but you need to show the how"  |  Paraphrase:  I would probably tell someone that they shouldn't attach their identity to their job.  On a more serious note, I would say that this is an arguement for why a social safety net is important, especially when the "robots are coming for our jobs"     |
| Clarity Questions |  Paraphrase:  The text is too small on the Employment graph.  I'm assuming the numbers are percentages, but I had to do the math in my head to check.  |  Same exact comments on the Employment graph; suggestion to change "Employment" to "Employment Status" Paraphrase:  Does your audience know where Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany are or do they need more information?  |  Paraphrasing:  The only thing that's unclear right now are the details, but I'm assuming the story makes sense in that way.  At first I wasn't sure why the time periods were so uneven, but after reading through it, I get it.           |
| Quality of Evidence Questions  |  Paraphrase:  If you find amazing data, then you can add it, but including data on the mines or the Dutch economy in general (I had previously discussed the data with this interviewee) doesn't seem necessary because it's not about the coal or the economy, it's about the people.  | Paraphrase:  Restructure the note you have on the employment status in 1972 so that you explain what you did first, then where the data is from second. Quote: "This is an awesome way to show data like this - you actually made that?" | Paraphrase:  I love the Italian ad and the newspaper headline as well as the 7 out of 10 people and "beautiful line graph thing".  Quote "Don't add statistics to add statistics - it will make this look like a homework assignment, which I guess it technically is though..."  |
| Redundancies Questions |  Paraphrase:  I think you have a nice balance between data and story based on the outline.  The data you are using allows the reader to put themselves in a coal miner's shoes. Quote:  I'm not sure you need the mine graph - Limburg is so small it doesn't matter where the mines are. |  Paraphrase:  You need to be mindful of how long you spend on the background "exposition" information compared to the vital information.  Quote:  "Are you going to talk about World War II?  Obviously.  But if your section on the early 1900s is two sentences, don't add more to make it balanced." | Paraphrased:  If the point of this is to say that the lesson from Limburg can be applied anywhere, why are you planning on adding a GDP graph?  If the lesson is universal, than it shouldn't matter what the economy looked like.  Quote:  "Stop making me look at economics when I don't have to" |
|  Other notes?  |  No other notes.    | Paraphrase: Change the family tree so the background matches the white background and edit the colors so it looks better | Paraphrase: If you can add some Dutch somewhere, that would be cool!   |

# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Drop the GDP and coal mining data?   | Although my graph was delayed due to me continuously messing up the data in Excel, the overwhelming consensus from my classmates and my interviews was that it's unecessary and feels like adding data to add data.  For this reason, I plan to find better, perhaps simpler, and more relevant statistics to add.|
|  Family Tree Modifications               |   I will edit the family tree so it aesthetically fits in with the rest of my Shorthand Story better by changing the background to white and adjusting the other colors to fit that change.         |
|    Fix the Employment Graph              |   I plan to change the label on the Employment to "Employment Status" as suggested, add the percent symbols to the numbers if possible (or find another way to clarify that), and rewrite the text explaining how I came up with the graph based on my feedback to explain my method first and then mention that the Dutch government had the records.              |
|   More Images/Primary Sources            |  My interviewees really appreciated the Italian advertisement and the Newspaper front page.  If I can find more sources like that, especially if any contain statistics or can help me explain additional data I find, that would be great.                |
|     Map Improvements        |   Since my map doesn't provide context on where the Netherlands is to someone who doesn't already know, I might add a map of Europe to help orient readers.  |
|    Throughline      |   Based on the questions I came up with, which have increased my self-awareness during this project, and the feedback I received, I plan to make sure that when reviewing my story, I look for any areas that I'm losing the throughline so I can fix them!  Similarly, I plan make sure I address the big takeaways clearly in the conclusion and may even add a call to action in the form of a question like "if you lose your job, does your government have a plan for you?.         |
|    Use details/info with captions, images, statistics to talk instead of text as much as possible      |    Using captions, more images, and hopefully a few more statistics, I plan keep the text at a minimum an attempt to let the additional features do "as much of the talking" as possible.  Hopefully, that will allow me to tell the story thoroughly, but without my reading feeling bogged down by text.                                                                           |

As I fill in all the text descriptions, especially in the time line like parts of my story, one of my main challenges will be keeping things short and sweet.  As my interviewees reminded me, a lot of the story tells itself in the 7 out of 10 graphic and the employment chart.  My job will be to fill in the "how" using the text blubs without asking my readers to dive into the weeds of economic development with me.

Working on this Final Project and researching about Limburg has made me think about how distant, yet connected to the world of Dutch coal mining I am as a current graduate student in the US that's in a former coal mining region.  One of the things that connects me to my coal mining ancestors is food, specifically my grandmother Wilhelmina's food, which she would have made for her father Hendrik and any family friends that were also coal miners.  Decades later, she made many of those same foods for me.  If I'm able to find a good recipe quickly enough and have it translated, I might add one of her recipes that she would have made as young women for her father after a long day in the mines and for me after a long afternoon on the playground.

# Moodboards / personas
I started working on a mood board, but quickly realized I couldn't find a way to capture what I was imagining with images as well as with words.  Oddly enough, I don't think I've ever hypothesized that I could communicate something better with words than images, but there is a first for everything.  The primary inspiration for my story's mood/tone is the PBS show "Finding Your Roots", which educates famous actors, singers, writers, performers, politicians, comedians, etc. on their family tree, usually by picking one or two lines of their ancestors and following them to a specific generation/time period.  They use a combination of historical documents, images, and typical resources like family trees and family photos when available.  My secondary influence was my Dutch great-aunt’s living room.  Although I was only able to visit a few times, her living room is decorated with knickknacks, photos, family heirlooms, and all sorts of memories from the past.  For me, it's impossible to separate that space from the story of my family and our history. Using primary sources and images, I hope to recreate that feeling for any Dutch person who might stumble across my story.  By using the design/mood inspired by a show about people and their family, as well as my great-aunt’s living room, I hope that my story will come across as one about economic transitions, but also about humans.
