# Wireframes / storyboards
<!--
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

In order to now overwhelm my critique participants, I used a combination of "lorem ipsum" text blurbs and main idea phrases to help provide minimal context when possible, such as on the timeline section.  My hope was that by focusing on the charts and overall structure, I could ensure that my narrative was sufficient, clear, and effective.

# User research 

## Target audience
<!--
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 
-->
My general target audience is lifelong learners, especially those in the US and Canada who may also have connections to the Dutch coal mining industry.  My specific target audience is students learning about economic development, researchers and policymakers who will be making important decisions regarding employment transitions, and members of the general public who are in the deeper phases of researching economic transitions on the internet.

Because I'm aiming for a diverse audience, I've attempted to take a fairly casual, yet educational tone, based off that Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr. on the PBS show "Finding Your Roots".  I'm hoping to strike a balance between my audience learning something new, but not needing to have an in-depth understanding of the Netherlands, its geography, or its politics.
