# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
To complete my final project, I plan to use either Storyboard or ESRI’s Story Maps feature depending on the data visualizations that make it into my final project.  First, I will work on testing and building my data visualizations and compiling my supporting photos, videos, etc.  Once I have that step complete and feel confident about my final design, I will build out my story using Storyboard, which I’m less familiar with, or Story Maps, which I have experimented with in GIS.  Lastly, I plan to use classroom critiques and the remaining classes to gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of both Storyboard and Story Maps so I’ll know how to choose the best fit for my data story.
