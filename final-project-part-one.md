# Final Project Part I
# Recipe for Resilience:  Lessons from Limburg

Note:  Formal citations pending – still figuring out how to do create a references section in Github.

For my final project, I plan on telling the story of the Limburg region of the Netherlands’ economic transitions of the 20th century through the lens of my family members.  In the early 1900s, the Dutch entered the prosperous industry of coal mining and opened nearly a dozen mines in the southern region of Limburg, located between Belgium and Germany.  In the mid-1900s, coal mining was not only the predominant local industry, but had largely become a regional identity.  In 1965, as the world began its transition to natural gas and oil, the Dutch government announced that all mines in Limburg would close within the next 10 years.  Despite a tumultuous transition during a national recession, Limburg eventually found its way forward to a post-coal era.
	
Throughout Limburg’s history, it has been predominantly Roman Catholic and shares some social similarities with the US south.  For those from Limburg, not being a member of the Protestant majority and having a distinct regional dialect have both been associated with limited social and economic mobility outside of the region.  Since Heinz College is in southwestern Pennsylvania, a geographic region that shares cultural uniqueness and whose own transition away from coal began just a decade later, I believe Pittsburghers can find similar patterns in Limburg’s story.  

Using mining statistics records, employment records from the transition, previous research on the Limburg coal mines and dismantling of the mining industry, I will tell the story of my ancestors, members of the Vroomen and Hermans families, and their journeys through an everchanging home.

# Project Structure Outline:

I hope to educate people on an example of what a transition into, through, and away from coal mining can look like through the lens of my family.  First, I plan to detail how quickly coal mining became the dominant industry in Limburg, the region my family was from in the Netherlands, and the impact it had on many families, including the accidental death of my great-grandfather in 1936.  Next, I plan to communicate that industries like coal can quickly become irrelevant when the next big thing, namely oil and gas, make them no longer profitable.  Finally, I will discuss the steps Limburg went through to successfully become an economy no longer reliant on coal, the effects of its transition on residents, and its eventually return to document its mining history in the early 2000s.

My dual call to action will be to remind the reader to look to other regions of the world when looking for solutions to policy/economic problems and that when possible, learning about the social, economic, and political transitions your relatives lived through can be a powerful learning experience.

# Initial sketches

> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

Maps (Hopefully made with Tableau, GIS, or one of our other tools)
Map of the Netherlands with the Limburg Region Highlighted
An additional map highlighting the locations of the coal mines throughout Limburg

*Since I’m unclear as to how to properly source an attempted map in Tableau and/or GIS, I have not yet created sample maps.

Idea without sketch:  I have yet to find a strong source of data, but I would like to create a visualization that helps communicate the decline of coals value as it was replaced in the energy sector by oil and natural gas.

Sketch 1:  This sketch shows the changing rate of coal production from 1961 to 2021 with the changing Dutch GDP growth rate.

Sketch 2:  This sketch of a pie chart communicates that approximately 70% of workers in the Limburg region worked in the mines or in jobs reliant on the mines as of 1960.

# The data
<!--
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
-->

In order to tell the story of Limburg’s transition from a major coal mining region in Europe the early to mid-1900s to a bustling center of trade and technology today, I selected several data sources for quantitative data to combine with qualitative data support from several of my family members.  

For quantitative data, one of my key resources is the website “De Mijnen (The Mines)” from the University of Delft.  It was created in response to a request of the Minister of Education 40 years after the closure of the last mine to provide a “digital platform for everything connected to Dutch coal mines”.  Today, a proportion of the information is still hosted digitally on the University of Delft website where the rest has been transferred over to a standalone website.

De Mijnen (The Mines) project has maps, the aggregate coal production data from the Limburg coal mines, and links to digital copies of the annual reports that were written and available to miners and community members in the Limburg region from 1929 until 1975, all which provide incredibly helpful contextual information.

To fully provide context, I will be supplementing this data with
-	national macroeconomic data from the OECD, ranging from 1961 until 2022 on the Dutch GDP annual growth rate. 
-	Supplemental data from several research papers that provide information on displaced workers, workers who transitioned from mining to retirement, etc.

Lastly, I plan to add personal family anecdotes and photos (if available) to help bring the story to life and ease the reader through the story as much as possible.

# Method and medium
To complete my final project, I plan to use either Storyhand or ESRI’s Story Maps feature depending on the data visualizations that make it into my final project.  First, I will work on testing and building my data visualizations and compiling my supporting photos, videos, etc.  Once I have that step complete and feel confident about my final design, I will build out my story using Storyhand, which I’m less familiar with, or Story Maps, which I have experimented with in GIS.  Lastly, I plan to use classroom critiques and the remaining classes to gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of both Storyhand and Story Maps so I’ll know how to choose the best fit for my data story.
