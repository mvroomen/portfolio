# Critique By Design

## Original Graph

The original graph was created for use by The Fertilizer Institute, a trade association in Washington D.C. to address the supply-side explanation for the increasing price of fertilizer in late 2021 for concerned farmers and agricultural retailers.  The US corn crop uses about 50% of the fertilizer supply, meaning that fertilizer demand is heavily correlated with corn prices.  As corn prices increase, more farmers plant corn and therefore demand more fertilizer, therefore, causing fertilizer prices to increase.  At the same time, when farmers plant more corn, they are often switching land from growing soybeans or wheat to corn, lowering the supply of soybeans/wheat, and therefore increasing their prices, which kicks off the same increase in price and higher demand for fertilizer as explained for corn.  The graph aims to provide price trend data to support this story.

The graph has several strengths and areas with room for improvement, but overall, it is an effective communication device when paired with its story.  With some improvements, it may be able to stand on its own.

Strengths:
The dual y-axes allow the graph to successfully convey both the corn price and fertilizer prices.

The features of the graph are fairly clear and easy to read

The green box highlights the focal point of the story

Color coding is used to differentiate between the various fertilizers and corn

The “static pop-up” conveys the percentage change for the important period of time

Nothing in the graph appears to be attempting to mislead the reader, nor is anything unclear in such a way that the reader is likely to come to wrong conclusions due to design

Areas with room for improvement:

(Note: to avoid being redundant, I address my fixes below my sketch)

The colors, as well as the intense grid lines, are very intense and distract from the message of the graph by adding unnecessary busyness

The green box, although effective, could be improved through shading the lines or that section of the graph.

Having the line labels sort of randomly on the graph can be slightly confusing and distracts from the main message of the graph.

The Y-axis on the right is lacking a label telling the reader it represents corn price

The “thought bubble” that says “Corn and Fertilizer Prices Rise!” conveys the main idea of the graph better than the title “Fertilizer and Corn Prices: January 2018-October 15, 2021”, which just tells the reader, in the most literal sense, what they are looking at

The “static pop-up” conveys too much information by having two sets of percentage changes

The corn data ends prior to the fertilizer data, which can potentially confuse the reader

Those who know enough to know why the fertilizers are labeled with (Midwest) and (Tampa), which indicate the location the pricing data is pulled from, probably don’t need that information on the graph, because they know the key “pricing” locations for these products

The X-axis and Y-axis on the left are too busy.  The both could see fewer data points.
