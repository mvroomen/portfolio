# Visualizing Government Debt
Below you'll see three visualizations, one made using the OECD website and two made using OECD data and Flourish.

## Data Visualization 1:  
## OECD Bar Graph - Total Government Debt as a Percentage of GDP for various nations

## Data Visualization 2:  
## Grid of Line Charts - Debt-to-GDP ratio for various nations from 1995 to 2019

## Data Visualization 3:  
## Greece's Growing Debt-to-GDP Ratio
### As of January 1, 1995, there were officially 15 European Union member states.  Over the course of the next 25 years, Greece would become a notorious outlier for its Debt-to-GDP ratio, far surpassing all of its fellow pre-millennium EU members.

## Analysis:
In viewing these three visualizations, we can see the benefits and drawbacks of various data visualization styles for the same data.  Data Visualization 1 uses a bar graph to clearly and effectively communicate a single year of data for 39 different countries.  We can clearly see who's on top, who at the bottom, and which countries are roughly around the middle.  However, we aren't able to see any trends across time.  Data visualization 2 uses a Grid of Line Charts to succinctly communicate 25 years of data for 35 countries.  Our eyes are able to pick up which countries appear to have roughly the same trajectory, while also being drawn to the graphs that are "not like the others".  Unfortunately, since the Grid of Line Charts are all next to each other with roughly the same hierarchy, it is harder for us to pinpoint any outliers or big ideas from the data (especially if we hadn't just seen the OECD bar graph).  With Data Visualization #3, my goal was to tell the story of Greece's Debt-to-GDP ratio compared to the other 14 countries that were also EU member states as of January 1, 1995.  The line chart race works effectively to tell the story of Greece's divergence from the other EU member states during the 25 year period of our data. However, one of the downsides of the Line Chart Race is that the stories of the other 14 member states become a bit muddled as they crowd together in the middle of the graph.  It's a great chart type for drawing attention to outliers, patterns, and trends.
